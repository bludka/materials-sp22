One of these factors is the rising or sinking of land due to plate tectonics, called **vertical land motion** (VLM). If the land is sinking at a coastal location AND the ocean in the region is rising, then the locals might be very worried. If instead the land is rising faster than the ocean is rising, then the locals might feel as if the ocean is receeding.
